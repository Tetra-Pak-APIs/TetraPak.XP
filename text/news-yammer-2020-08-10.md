# API authorization goes open source

Last week the Bold Eagles team released version 1.1.1 of the TAX authorization NuGet package, allowing easy consumption of Tetra Pak APIs for any native mobile client based on the .NET development platform. Not only does the package allow very fast and easy access to Tetra Pak APIs, it is now also globally available as an open source project.

Head over to the [Tetra Pak developer portal][tetra-pak-developer-portal] to read more about how this open source package can help your project be consuming Tetra Pak data in less than twenty minutes.
